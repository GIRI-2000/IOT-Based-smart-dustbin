# IOT-Based-smart-dustbin
Here using IOT ,we will actually automate a dustbin.When a person comes near to the samrt dustbin if he stands for more than 5ms then the ultrasonic sensor senses its proximity and sends signal to Arduino.Then the servo motor rotates and hence the lids of the dustbin just opens up.
